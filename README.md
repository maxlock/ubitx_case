# ubitx_case
SVG template to create a laser cut case for the ubitx transceiver. CC-BY-SA-4.0 license.

Based upon a box template from http://www.makercase.com/ it has internal dimensions 200 x 60 x 180mm and is designed for 3mm thick materials.

This SVG is setup for use with the scorchworks laserdraw plugin. Red lines are cuts, Blue is raster engraving and green shows parts placement which can be ignored. The yellow rounded rectangle can be cut from clear perspex and used to protect the LCD display. The squared U shaped pieces form a slot bracket for a speaker to mount behind the left hand grille, and the two bars glue together and sit behind the sockets to stop them pushing into the case.

The rear panel holes are for a chassis usb B connector, a D type (just because) and the fuse, power and antenna connections. The rear grille cutouts have mounting holes for a larger commonly available heatsink (76mm x 60mm x 21.5mm).
